# MultiLanguage-invoice-extraction-with-LLM
In this project, I used the state of the art google's gemini pro vision model to extract invoices from Different Languages and translate them into Engish. I asked different queries based on the invoice and gemini model answered accordingly. I added the Results directory where the answers can be found.

## Use Case:
This is a personal project that is designed to help me translate and get answers on specific questions about invoices. As Finnish is not my native language and I get a lot of invoices in Finnish, this script will help me to find exact information I am looking for and translate back in English.

## Technology Used:
1. Google's Gemini Pro LLM model
2. Streamlit application
3. Vs Code
4. Conda Virtual Environments
5. Version Control (Git)
6. Standard Practies
